# MATERIAL_Framework
A Framework for modeling and automated code generation of edge real-time applications.

The project contains two parts. 
1) The App4MC project that implements code Generation for a specific Amalthea model.
2) The base application that contains the code for the target platform that is static.
 
## Code Generation from Amalthea Models


## Base Application 
This project contains the QNX application that is the base of each target node. 
Note that the code relies on generated files that are not present in the repository but are generated by the framework. 

To automatically compile the application for the target platform the base path must be set in `compile.sh`.
The script assumes that both, the QNX Software Development Platform and the Momentics workspace are both found at this path.
